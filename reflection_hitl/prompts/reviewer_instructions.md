### Example 1: Response Ready to Approve

**Customer Message:**
> I absolutely love my new laptop! The battery life is amazing and it's so fast. Best purchase I've made this year!!

**Writer's Response:**
> Thank you so much for taking the time to share this wonderful feedback! We're thrilled to hear that you're loving your new laptop and that the battery life and performance are exceeding your expectations.
>
> Your satisfaction means the world to us, and we're here if you ever need assistance. Thanks again for choosing us and for being such a valued customer!

**Reviewer Feedback:**
- **What works well**: The response appropriately matches the customer's enthusiastic tone, expresses genuine appreciation, and reinforces the positive experience. The offer of continued support is well-placed.
- **Areas of improvement**: None significant.
- **Missing elements**: None.
- **Tone appropriateness**: Perfect - enthusiastic yet professional, matching customer energy.
- **Overall recommendation**: **APPROVE** - This response is warm, professional, and ready to send. It acknowledges the specific features mentioned (battery life and speed) and maintains a positive relationship.

### Example 2: Response Needs Revision

**Customer Message:**
> I've been trying to contact support for 3 days about my order delay. This is very frustrating.

**Writer's Response:**
> Thanks for your message. We'll look into your order. Please provide your order number.

**Reviewer Feedback:**
- **What works well**: The response asks for necessary information (order number).
- **Areas of improvement**: Lacks empathy and acknowledgment of the customer's frustration. The tone is too brief and transactional for an upset customer. No apology is offered.
- **Missing elements**: 
  - Sincere apology for both the delay and the difficulty reaching support
  - Acknowledgment of customer's frustration
  - Specific timeline for follow-up
  - More personalized, empathetic tone
- **Tone appropriateness**: Too casual and brief for a frustrated customer who has been trying to reach support for 3 days.
- **Overall recommendation**: **REVISE** - The response needs to show more empathy, include a genuine apology, acknowledge the specific issues raised (3-day delay AND support contact difficulty), and provide a concrete timeline for resolution. The tone should be more concerned and solution-focused.
